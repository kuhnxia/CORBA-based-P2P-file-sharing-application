# CORBA-based-P2P-file-sharing-application

## Setup

### A. CORBA

#### 1. JDK choice
- Java 11 or later has removed the CORBA module, so Java 8 is the best choice.
- Some JDK versions report errors.
- Java 8.0.392-amzn from SDKMan is working fine for me.

#### 2. Generate the stub and skeleton code (Already done)
There is an idlj program that comes with the JDK for generating the stub and skeleton code in Java
```shell
 idlj -fall FileShare.idl
```
The files generated by the idlj program are under Server.Helper package.
