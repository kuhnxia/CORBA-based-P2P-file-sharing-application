# CORBA-based-P2P-file-sharing-application

## Setup

### A. CORBA

#### 1. JDK choice
- Java 11 or later has removed the CORBA module, so Java 8 is the best choice.
- Some JDK versions report errors.
- Java 8.0.392-amzn from SDKMan is working fine for me.

#### 2. Generate the stub and skeleton code (Already done)
There is an idlj program that comes with the JDK for generating the stub and skeleton code in Java
```shell
 idlj -fall FileShare.idl
```
The java files generated by the idlj program are under **Helper** package.

#### 3. Running the application
1. Start the ORB server
    ```shell
    orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost
    ```

2. add the below program argument to the server/client application at **Run/Debug Configurations**.
    ```shell
    -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost
    ```
